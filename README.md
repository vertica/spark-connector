# Vertica Spark Connector

This component acts as a bridge between Spark and Vertica, allowing the user to either retrieve data from Vertica for processing in Spark, or store processed data from Spark into Vertica.

Why is this connector desired instead of using a more generic JDBC connector? A few reasons:
* Vertica-specific syntax and features. This connector can support things like Vertica projections
* Authentication to the Vertica server 
* Segmentation. We can use the way that Vertica segments data to inform our operations. 
* Ability to use other technology as an intermediary for data transfer. This is necessary for maximizing performance of parallel loads.

This connector is built as a JAR file to be sourced in your spark application. This is accessible through [maven central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/vertica/spark/vertica-spark/) or you can build the JAR yourself with sbt assembly.

The connector relies on a distributed filesystem, such as HDFS, to act as a bridge between Spark and Vertica. This is done to allow for maximum performance at high scale.

## Getting Started

To get started with using the connector, we'll need to make sure all the prerequisites are in place. These are:
- A Vertica installation
- An HDFS cluster or S3 bucket, for use as an intermediary between Spark and Vertica
- A spark application, either running locally for quick testing, or running on a spark cluster. If using S3, Spark must be using hadoop 3.3

For an easier quick test of the connector using a dockerized environment, see [this guide for running our examples.](examples/README.md)

### Vertica 

Follow the [Vertica Documenation](https://www.vertica.com/docs/10.0.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/InstallationGuide/Other/InstallationGuide.htm) for steps on installing Vertica.

### Spark

There are several examples of spark programs that use this connector in the [examples](/examples) directory. 

The methods for creating a spark cluster are documented [here](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/cluster-overview.html).

Once you have a spark cluster, you can run such an application with spark-submit, including the connector jar.

```shell
spark-submit --master spark://cluster-url.com:7077 --deploy-mode cluster sparkconnectorprototype-assembly-0.1.jar
```

### HDFS Cluster

An HDFS setup can have various configurations, for details of what might best fit your infrastructure the [HDFS Architecture Guide](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_design.html) is recommended.

For a quick start, you can either check out our [Guide on setting up a single-node HDFS](hdfs_single_node_instructions.md) or if you are just wanting a quick test run, you can use an HDFS container in Docker [as documented in our contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#hdfs).

However you set up HDFS, Vertica needs to have a copy of the hadoop configuration (location of hdfs-site.xml and core-site.xml). Each Vertica node must have access. Options for this are to either copy said configuration to /etc/hadoop/conf on those machines, or to tell Vertica where to find the configuration like so:

```shell
ALTER DATABASE <database name> SET HadoopConfDir = '/hadoop/conf/location/';
```
### Java 

Spark Connector requires Java 8 (8u92 or later) or Java 11.

### Scala

For the Spark connector, Spark 3.0.0 and above use Scala 2.12. You will need to use a compatible Scala version (2.12.x).

### AWS S3

Follow our [S3 user manual](https://github.com/vertica/spark-connector/blob/main/S3UserManual.md) to learn how to use the connector with S3.

## Connector Usage

Using the connector in Spark is straightforward. It requires the data source name, an options map, and if writing to Vertica, a [Spark Save Mode](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/api/java/index.html?org/apache/spark/sql/SaveMode.html).


```scala
val opts = Map(
    "host" -> "vertica_hostname",
    "user" -> "vertica_user",
    "db" -> "db_name",
    "password" -> "db_password",
    "staging_fs_url" -> "hdfs://hdfs-url:7077/data",
    "table" -> "tablename"
  )

// Create data and put it in a dataframe
val schema = new StructType(Array(StructField("col1", IntegerType)))
val data = Seq(Row(77))
val df = spark.createDataFrame(spark.sparkContext.parallelize(data), schema).coalesce(1)

val mode = SaveMode.ErrorIfExists

// Write the dataframe to Vertica
df.write.format("com.vertica.spark.datasource.VerticaSource").options(opts ).mode(mode).save()

// Read it back from Vertica
val dfRead: DataFrame = spark.read.format("com.vertica.spark.datasource.VerticaSource").options(opts).load()
```
The Spark connector converts all Spark SQL Strings to Vertica VARCHAR values. The length of these VARCHAR values defaults to 1024 (octet length). You can change the octet length of the VARCHAR that is stored in Vertica by setting the `strlen` option in the option Map.

### Note on permissions

The connector, using an intermediary file location between Spark and Vertica, may require both sides to have write access to the intermediary location used. 

The default permission (configurable via the 'file_permissions' option) is '700', or access only for the given user. This is the default for security reasons, but will cause issues if your user running spark and database user are different.

There are a few ways to solve this:
- Change the file_permissions option to a suitable value. Warning: setting this to '777' means any user with filesystem access could read the data being transfered. Setting this to '770' could work if users on each side of the operation share a group.
- Change the operation to use the same user for spark and the database
- Use export HADOOP_USER_NAME=<vertica-db-name> to have spark's hadoop communication use the same user as the DB


### Connector Options

| target_table_sql (previously target_table_ddl) | String                                              | A SQL statement to run in Vertica before copying data. You usually use this option to create the target table to receive the data from Spark. The table this statement creates should match the table name you specify in the table option. See Creating the Destination Table From Spark for more information. This connector option is different from 'query', as this option is ran before a write operation, typically with a custom statement to create a table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | No                                            |                             |

This option lets you adjust the data so that the Vertica table and the Spark data frame do not have to have the same number of columns. See Copying Data to a Table With a Different Schema for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | No                                            |                             |
| num_partitions (previously numpartitions)      | Int                                                 | The number of Spark partitions used when reading from Vertica. Each of these will correspond to a task with its own JDBC connection. Performance testing has indicated that the ideal number of partitions is 4*N where N is the number nodes in the Vertica cluster for the direct read method. Most efficient partition count for intermediate method may vary, will require testing and may be a tradeoff of memory vs time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | No                                            | 1 per exported parquet file |
| staging_fs_url (previously hdfs_url)           | URL String                                          | The fully-qualified path to a directory in HDFS or S3 that will be used as a data staging area. For example, hdfs://myhost:8020/data/test. For S3, the URL should begin with s3a://. The connector first saves the DataFrame in its entirety to this location before loading into Vertica. The data is saved in Parquet format, and the files are saved in a directory specific to each job. This directory is then deleted when the job completes. Note that you need additional configuration changes to use HDFS. You must first configure all nodes to use HDFS. See Configuring the hdfs Scheme. Note: this option is also used to specify the filepath for external tables, where the external table may be loaded or saved to this location. Please see create_external_table for more details.                                                                            | Yes                                           |                             |
| merge_key                                      | String                                              | In order to execute a merge statement in our Spark Connector, the user needs to pass in a merge key, which will be a list of comma-separated column attributes to join the existing table and temporary table on ("foo, bar, baz" or "foo,bar,baz"). Note: the merge key must be unique in the dataframe for the merge to work. Additionally, the number of columns in the dataframe must be less than or equal to the number of columns in the target table. If the number of columns in the dataframe are less than the target table and the names of the columns differ, use copy_column_list to match the dataframe columns against the target table columns. Last note: while you may use copy_column_list to get around differing column names between the dataframe and existing table, the column names of the merge_key must match in both schemas.                      
| create_external_table                          | "new-data"/"true" or "existing-data" (String)        | An option to create an external table, either out of existing parquet data in HDFS or by writing data from Spark to HDFS. For the latter use-case, specify this option as "new-data" or "true". For the former use-case, specify this option as "existing-data". For both cases, you must specify either the location of the external table or location of existing data in the "staging_fs_url" connector option ("webhdfs://hdfs:50070/data/data.parquet/"). For existing-data, ensure that the spark dataframe you are writing is empty. Note: When creating an external table from existing data, partitioned columns will require you provide a partial schema detailing those columns.

Alternatively, you can set the spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.session.token option in the Spark configuration or the environment variable AWS_SESSION_TOKEN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | No                                            |                             |

For example, if you want to use the IAMInstanceCredentialsProvider, you would specify this option as "org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.auth.IAMInstanceCredentialsProvider". Specifying this option sets the AWS credentials provider option in the Hadoop configuration. Alternatively, you can set the spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.aws.credentials.provider option in the Spark configuration. If left blank, Hadoop will default to trying SimpleAWSCredentialsProvider, EnvironmentVariableCredentialsProvider, and InstanceProfileCredentialsProvider in order. Please note that we have only tested the connector with SimpleAWSCredentialsProvider and IAMInstanceCredentialsProvider, so other credential providers will have limited support.                                                                                                              | No                                            |                             |

Note: If you are using the S3 properties, the connector options has priority over the Spark configuration, which has priority over the environment variables.

## Examples

If you would like to try out the connector, we have several example applications you can run [in the examples folder](https://github.com/vertica/spark-connector/tree/main/examples).

## Configuring Logging

The connector uses Spark's log4j configuration for logging. Logging is configured by updating the `$SPARK_HOME/log4j.properties` file on the worker nodes. The log4j.properties file needs to be in the classpath as well.

Here is an example spark-submit command showing how to add Spark's default configuration folder to the classpath:
`spark-submit --master spark://spark:7077 --conf "spark.driver.extraClassPath={$SPARK_HOME}/conf/" --deploy-mode cluster app-assembly.jar --class Main`
where `{$SPARK_HOME}` is the `$SPARK_HOME` directory on the worker node.

Our connector logs major events when reading and writing, such as when it is copying a table from the intermediary file store into Vertica or exporting from Vertica into the intermediary file store. We also log errors and caveats around usage of the connector and connector options. Along with errors, the connector logs warnings when the usage of the connector is not as expected. In addition, we log info such as SQL statements, schemas, and filters that are used when manipulating relations or the data in those relations. In order to get a lower level view of our connector operations, a user may change the log level to ‘Debug’. The debug log level will give more details around specific components, such as partition information, impersonation tokens, and cleanup information.

## Additional guides

For information on how to configure Kerberos and TLS with the connector, see the [KerberosUserManual.md](https://github.com/vertica/spark-connector/blob/main/KerberosUserManual.md) and [TLSConfiguration.md](https://github.com/vertica/spark-connector/blob/main/TLSConfiguration.md) files in the root of this repository.

For information on tuning performance, see [here in our performance-tests section.](performance-tests/README.md)

## Limitations

The connector supports versions of Spark between 3.0 and 3.1.1.

The connector supports basic Spark types. Complex types are not currently supported (arrays, maps, structs).

If using S3 rather than HDFS, the spark cluster must be running with hadoop 3.3. Our [S3 user manual](https://github.com/vertica/spark-connector/blob/main/S3UserManual.md) goes over how to configure this.

You may see an error such as:
21/05/31 17:35:21 ERROR DFSClient: Failed to close inode 16447

This is simply an issue with hadoop closing file handles on files that have been cleaned up by the connector. It does not cause any functional issues.
