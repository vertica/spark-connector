# Vertica Spark Connector

This component acts as a bridge between Spark and Vertica, allowing the user to either retrieve data from Vertica for processing in Spark, or store processed data from Spark into Vertica.

Why is this connector desired instead of using a more generic JDBC connector? A few reasons:
* Vertica-specific syntax and features. This connector can support things like Vertica projections
* Authentication to the Vertica server 
* Segmentation. We can use the way that Vertica segments data to inform our operations. 
* Ability to use other technology as an intermediary for data transfer. This is necessary for maximizing performance of parallel loads.

This connector is built as a JAR file to be sourced in your spark application. This is accessible through [maven central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/vertica/spark/vertica-spark/) or you can build the JAR yourself with sbt assembly.

The connector relies on a distributed filesystem, such as HDFS, to act as a bridge between Spark and Vertica. This is done to allow for maximum performance at high scale.

## Getting Started

To get started with using the connector, we'll need to make sure all the prerequisites are in place. These are:
- A Vertica installation
- An HDFS cluster, for use as an intermediary between Spark and Vertica
- A spark application, either running locally for quick testing, or running on a spark cluster.

For an easier quick test of the connector using a dockerized environment, see [this guide for running our examples.](examples/README.md)

### Vertica 

Follow the [Vertica Documenation](https://www.vertica.com/docs/10.0.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/InstallationGuide/Other/InstallationGuide.htm) for steps on installing Vertica.

### Spark

There are several examples of spark programs that use this connector in the [examples](/examples) directory. 

The methods for creating a spark cluster are documented [here](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/cluster-overview.html).

Once you have a spark cluster, you can run such an application with spark-submit, including the connector jar.

```shell
spark-submit --master spark://cluster-url.com:7077 --deploy-mode cluster sparkconnectorprototype-assembly-0.1.jar
```

### HDFS Cluster

An HDFS setup can have various configurations, for details of what might best fit your infrastructure the [HDFS Architecture Guide](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_design.html) is recommended.

For a quick start, you can either check out our [Guide on setting up a single-node HDFS](hdfs_single_node_instructions.md) or if you are just wanting a quick test run, you can use an HDFS container in Docker [as documented in our contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#hdfs).

However you set up HDFS, Vertica needs to have a copy of the hadoop configuration (location of hdfs-site.xml and core-site.xml). Each Vertica node must have access. Options for this are to either copy said configuration to /etc/hadoop/conf on those machines, or to tell Vertica where to find the configuration like so:

```shell
ALTER DATABASE <database name> SET HadoopConfDir = '/hadoop/conf/location/';
```
### Java 

The current versions of Java that are compatible with Spark are Java8 and Java11. 

### AWS S3

Follow our [S3 user manual](https://github.com/vertica/spark-connector/blob/main/S3UserManual.md) to learn how to use the connector with S3.

## Connector Usage

Using the connector in Spark is straightforward. It requires the data source name, an options map, and if writing to Vertica, a [Spark Save Mode](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/api/java/index.html?org/apache/spark/sql/SaveMode.html).


```scala
val opts = Map(
    "host" -> "vertica_hostname",
    "user" -> "vertica_user",
    "db" -> "db_name",
    "password" -> "db_password",
    "staging_fs_url" -> "hdfs://hdfs-url:7077/data",
    "logging_level" -> "ERROR",
    "table" -> "tablename"
  )

// Create data and put it in a dataframe
val schema = new StructType(Array(StructField("col1", IntegerType)))
val data = Seq(Row(77))
val df = spark.createDataFrame(spark.sparkContext.parallelize(data), schema).coalesce(1)

val mode = SaveMode.ErrorIfExists

// Write the dataframe to Vertica
df.write.format("com.vertica.spark.datasource.VerticaSource").options(opts ).mode(mode).save()

// Read it back from Vertica
val dfRead: DataFrame = spark.read.format("com.vertica.spark.datasource.VerticaSource").options(opts).load()
```

### Note on permissions

The connector, using an intermediary file location between Spark and Vertica, may require both sides to have write access to the intermediary location used. 

The default permission (configurable via the 'file_permissions' option) is '700', or access only for the given user. This is the default for security reasons, but will cause issues if your user running spark and database user are different.

There are a few ways to solve this:
- Change the file_permissions option to a suitable value. Warning: setting this to '777' means any user with filesystem access could read the data being transfered. Setting this to '770' could work if users on each side of the operation share a group.
- Change the operation to use the same user for spark and the database
- Use export HADOOP_USER_NAME=<vertica-db-name> to have spark's hadoop communication use the same user as the DB

| target_table_sql (previously target_table_ddl) | String                                             | A SQL statement to run in Vertica before copying data. You usually use this option to create the target table to receive the data from Spark. The table this statement creates should match the table name you specify in the table option. See Creating the Destination Table From Spark for more information. This connector option is different from 'query', as this option is ran before a write operation, typically with a custom statement to create a table.                                                                                                                                        | No                                                                 |                             |

This option lets you adjust the data so that the Vertica table and the Spark data frame do not have to have the same number of columns.

| num_partitions (previously numpartitions)      | Int                                                | The number of Spark partitions used when reading from Vertica. Each of these will correspond to a task with its own JDBC connection. Performance testing has indicated that the ideal number of partitions is 4*N where N is the number nodes in the Vertica cluster for the direct read method. Most efficient partition count for intermediate method may vary, will require testing and may be a tradeoff of memory vs time.                                                                                                                                                                              | No                                                                 | 1 per exported parquet file |

For example, hdfs://myhost:8020/data/test. For S3, the URL should begin with s3a://. The connector first saves the DataFrame in its entirety to this location before loading into Vertica. The data is saved in Parquet format, and the files are saved in a directory specific to each job. This directory is then is deleted when the job completes. Note that you need additional configuration changes for to use HDFS. You must first configure all nodes to use HDFS.

Alternatively, you can set the spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.aws.credentials.provider option in the Spark configuration. If left blank, Hadoop will default to trying SimpleAWSCredentialsProvider, EnvironmentVariableCredentialsProvider, and InstanceProfileCredentialsProvider in order. Please note that we have only tested the connector with SimpleAWSCredentialsProvider and IAMInstanceCredentialsProvider, so other credential providers will have limited support.              | No                                                                 |                             |

Note: If you are using the S3 properties, the connector options has priority over the Spark configuration, which has priority over the environment variables.

## Examples

If you would like to try out the connector, we have several example applications you can run [in the examples folder](https://github.com/vertica/spark-connector/tree/main/examples).

## Configuring Logging

The connector uses Spark's log4j configuration for logging. Logging is configured by updating the `$SPARK_HOME/log4j.properties` file on the worker nodes. The log4j.properties file needs to be in the classpath as well.

Here is an example spark-submit command showing how to add Spark's default configuration folder to the classpath:
`spark-submit --master spark://spark:7077 --conf "spark.driver.extraClassPath={$SPARK_HOME}/conf/" --deploy-mode cluster app-assembly.jar --class Main`
where `{$SPARK_HOME}` is the `$SPARK_HOME` directory on the worker node.

## Additional guides

For information on how to configure Kerberos and TLS with the connector, see the [KerberosUserManual.md](https://github.com/vertica/spark-connector/blob/main/KerberosUserManual.md) and [TLSConfiguration.md](https://github.com/vertica/spark-connector/blob/main/TLSConfiguration.md) files in the root of this repository.

For information on tuning performance, see [here in our performance-tests section.](performance-tests/README.md)

## Limitations

The connector supports versions of Spark between 3.0 and 3.1.1.

The connector supports basic Spark types. Complex types are not currently supported.
