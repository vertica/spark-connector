# Pyspark Example

The connector can be used with pyspark, it must simply be sourced as a JAR file. 

An example application is provided alongside a .sh file which shows how to run such an application with the connector. It can be run using "./run-python-example.sh". This script will download Python3, Spark, and Hadoop and configure them before running the example.
