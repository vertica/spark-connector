# How to run the examples

Note: The instructions for running the S3 example are different. If you would like to run that example, please see [the README for that example](https://github.com/vertica/spark-connector/tree/main/examples/s3-example).

Make sure you have docker and sbt installed.
Tested using docker 20.10.0, sbt 1.4.1

Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/vertica/spark-connector.git
```
From the project's root directory:
```
cd docker
docker compose up -d
```
This will create a docker image for a client container and docker containers for a sandbox client environment and single-node clusters for both Vertica and HDFS.

Run the following commands to update the HDFS configuration files and restart HDFS:
```
docker exec docker_hdfs_1 cp /hadoop/conf/core-site.xml /opt/hadoop/etc/hadoop/core-site.xml
docker exec docker_hdfs_1 cp /hadoop/conf/hdfs-site.xml /opt/hadoop/etc/hadoop/hdfs-site.xml
docker exec docker_hdfs_1 /opt/hadoop/sbin/stop-dfs.sh
docker exec docker_hdfs_1 /opt/hadoop/sbin/start-dfs.sh
```

Run `docker exec -it docker_client_1 /bin/bash` to enter the sandbox client environment.

Now change your working directory to one in `spark-connector/examples` 

After changing your directory to a specific example (such as `spark-connector/examples/kerberos-example`), just enter `sbt run`

If you decide to run the demo example from the `/spark-connector/examples/demo` directory, run `sbt "run [CASE]"` to run the various cases.



Once you're finished running the examples exit out of the interactive terminal by running `exit`. When you are done using the containers, make sure you are in the docker directory and run: `docker-compose down`. This will shut down and remove the containers safely.
